### Built With

This Web App is built using React and styled with Styled-Components. Axios was used for the http call. Axios uses the data property which makes it easy and better for such calls compared to fetch which uses body property to deal with data. React hooks/packages used to achieve certain implementation such as state management, routing e.t.c. Custom hook was created to implement infinite pagination. Framer motion was use for animations, it's a light weighted library hugely supported in react which is simple to use. React-interception-observer was use to make certain event triggers in the dom. Reacttimeago was used in implementing created at date. FontAwesome library was use for all the icons used for the project.
